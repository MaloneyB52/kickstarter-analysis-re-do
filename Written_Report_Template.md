# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

The overview of this project is to consult Louise to make good decisions on her play "Fever" escpecilly in comparison to other shows' launch dates

### Purpose

To allow Louise to make a sound decision on when to launch while fundraising builds upon its success

## Analysis and Challenges

The challenges are to ensure the data set allows us to compare apples to apples. Hence, the large data set must be analyzed within its context. To that end, this means elimiating categoroes susch as film and television, animation and several others

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The dtats clearly shows that the vast majoroity of successful plays launch in the summer months, with a large spike in May steadily decreasing through the summer. Failed shows show a similiar spike in number as successful ones drop, thus strengthening the arguement that summer launches fare best. Fall and Winter launch dates decline. One can infer, that this is due to many factors and that the industry as a whole has concluded that summer launches work best.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The Goals results tend to favor the idea that a minimum financing goal of $30,000 is sufficient for launch. However, success has been garnered by many in the 10K to 15K range. It also shows that raising money is not necessarily the single harbinger of success, due to the similar financing numbers between succesful and failed. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Challenges with the data set wwre encountered in Cancellations, thus data is inconclusive. I do not believe it will skew the decision process, but we acknowledge the missing dtata set and are taking measures to include cancellations with more refinement.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Our conclusion is to recommend a late Spring early summer launch date to maximize the chances for success

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Our conclusion is that Louis must raise at least 1000 to 4999 to achieve success

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

The data is a comaprative analysis, meaning it takes data from previous theatrical efforts to reach a general framework. However, theater success hinges on many factors not the least of which is quality of production, location, talent pools and marketing. All of these need to be considered (and more!) before investing and/or producing a play. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

We could do similar analysis of failed only and quantify where the problems arise
